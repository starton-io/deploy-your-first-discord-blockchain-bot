# Deploy your first blockchain bot using Starton

## Introduction

This repo is related to an [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu/) workshop led by [Starton](https://starton.io).</br>
This workshop will allow you to build your first (or not) Discord bot connected to the blockchain using Starton (it's very easy you'll see).</br>
During the 2 following hours, you'll develop a Discord bot thanks to what you can airdrop NFTs to the users of your Discord server.</br>

### What is Starton ?

Starton is a (wonderful :eyes:) start-up that provide developers an easy way to interact with the blockchain through their API.</br>
With only few lines, you can automatically deploy a smart-contract, launch an NFT collection, follow the activity of [Vitalik Buterin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) and so on, **without think about the blockchain complexity** (the [nonces](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp#:~:text=In%20cryptocurrency%2C%20a%20nonce%20is,to%20receive%20the%20block%20reward.), the [gas fees](https://www.moonpay.com/learn/defi/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees), etc).
